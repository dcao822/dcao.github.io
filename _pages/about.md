About
======
* Hi! I am CAO Ding 曹鼎, a junior researcher at the GBA Branch of Aerospace Information Research Institute（广东大湾区空天信息研究院）, Chinese Academy of Sciences.  

* I received my B.Eng. degree in Macromolecular Materials and Engineering from Soochow University (mainland, China) at 2018. During my undergraduate studies in Soochow University, I joined the research group of [Professor CHENG Si](https://textile.suda.edu.cn/bf/3c/c6547a376636/page.htm) for 3 years and had a wonderful time with nanoparticles and thermochromic materials.  

* After that, I joined the research group of [Professor WU Yilin](https://www.phy.cuhk.edu.hk/ylwu/index.html) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and received my PhD degree in Materials Science and Engineering at 2023. My PhD career focused on bacterial locomotion in complex environments. 

 

Research
======
I am interested in the interdisciplinary researches between microbiology and terahertz optics.
