About
======
Hi! I am CAO Ding, a junior researcher at the GBA Branch of Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences.  

I received my B.Eng. degree from Soochow University (mainland, China) at 2018. During my undergraduate studies in Soochow University, I joined the research group of Professor CHENG Si for 3 years and had a wonderful time with nanoparticles and thermochromic materials.  

After that, I joined the research group of Professor WU Yilin at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and received my PhD degree at 2023. My PhD career focused on bacterial locomotion in complex environments. 

 

Research

I am interested in the interdisciplinary researches between microorganisms and optics.
